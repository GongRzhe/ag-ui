# üöÄ My New Feature

## What This Demo Shows

This demo showcases a custom AG-UI feature that demonstrates:
1. **Custom Component Integration**: How to create a new feature within the AG-UI dojo
2. **Agent-Frontend Communication**: Bidirectional communication between the agent and React components
3. **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic updates to the UI based on agent interactions
4. **Tool Integration**: Using `useCopilotAction` to define frontend tools

## How to Interact

Try asking the agent to:
- "Update the feature data to 'Hello from the agent!'"
- "Change the data to something creative"
- "Set the feature data to a random number"
- "Update the information with today's date"

You can also engage in general conversation while the agent has access to your custom tools.

## ‚ú® Key Implementation Details

**What's happening technically:**
- The React component defines a frontend action using `useCopilotAction`
- The agent automatically discovers and can call this action
- When the agent calls `update_feature_data`, the UI updates immediately
- The agent provides conversational feedback about the changes

**Feature Components:**
- **Main Display Area**: Shows the current feature data
- **Chat Interface**: Allows natural language interaction with the agent
- **Real-time Updates**: State changes are reflected instantly in the UI

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Opportunities

This pattern can be extended to:
- Data visualization updates
- Form field manipulation  
- Navigation and routing
- File operations
- API integrations
- Complex state management

## Architecture

This feature follows the AG-UI protocol pattern:
- Frontend defines available tools via `useCopilotAction`
- Agent receives tool definitions automatically
- Agent can call tools based on user requests
- Frontend handles tool execution and UI updates
- Agent provides conversational responses

The agent for this feature is configured as `myNewFeatureAgent` in the CopilotKit setup.
